/**
 * Hash-powered buffer for outgoing flows.
 * This is where outbound flows are aggregated while waiting to be exported.
 *
 * The Hashtable module receives flows from higher levels,
 * collects them in Buffers, then passes them on to lower levels by calling the
 * appropriate callback functions.
 *
 * Flows that differ only in aggregatable fields (like @c IPFIX_TYPEID_inOctetDeltaCount) are
 * aggregated.
 * If for a buffered flow no new aggregatable flows arrive for a certain timespan
 * or the flow was kept buffered for a certain amount of time it is
 * passed on to lower levels (i.e. exported) and removed from the hashtable.
 *
 * Polling for expired flows is accomplished by periodically calling @c expireFlows().
 *
 * Each @c Hashtable contains some fixed-value IPFIX fields @c Hashtable.data
 * described by the @c Hashtable.dataInfo array. The remaining, variable-value
 * fields are stored in @c Hashtable.buckets[].data structures described by the
 * @c Hashtable.fieldInfo array.
