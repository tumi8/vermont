NOTES ON MONITORING PORTS

Some switches add an additional field VLAN with size 4Bytes to the layer
2 header. So you have to adjust the <pcap_filter> setting to "vlan and ip".
Futhermore, the Packet::IPHeaderOffset has to adjusted to 18. This can be
done via ccmake . (IP_HEADER_OFFSET).


NOTES ON SOCKET RECEIVE BUFFER
If incoming IPFIX traffic is bursty, increasing the socket receive buffer
reduces packet losses.
System calls for Linux with proc file system:
$ cat /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_default
$ cat /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max
Write new value X (in bytes):
$ sysctl -w net/core/rmem_default=X
$ sysctl -w net/core/rmem_max=X
