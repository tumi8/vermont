This is VERMONT - VERsatile MONitoring Tool.
IPFIX/PSAMP probe
Released under GPL2, no guarantees, no warranty


REQUIREMENTS

Decent and recent gcc compiler w/ C++ support (there are some gcc-isms)
libpcap
*nix (Linux and recent FreeBSD preferred, other untested)


INSTALLATION

#> make
edit test.ini
#> ./vermont -f test.ini -dddd

Right now, there are only dirty Makefiles in place, so you may want to do a
full make clean before a rebuild.

If you want more debugging output, define DEBUG that Makefile of which
subsystem you want more output from - that is, add -DDEBUG to CFLAGS.
If you want to use it production-wise don't define it - nasty output.

Technically it allows the DPRINTF()s in the source to be in effect.


CONFIGURATION

Packaged comes a commented test.ini file.
As there are 2 subsystems, each one can be configured indepentently.


SAMPLER

Does packet sampling, reads raw packet data from an interface, put them thru
a filtering mechanism and finally export matching packets to an PSAMP/IPFIX 
collector.


CONCENTRATOR

Reads IPFIX/Netflow data from socket, aggregates data for certain flows, 
exports this data again via IPFIX.


THE HOOK

You can configure VERMONT to inject SAMPLER's captured packets into the
CONCENTRATOR for aggregation and export.


NOTES ON MONITORING PORTS

Some switches add an additional field VLAN with size 4Bytes.
So you have to adjust the pcap_expression to "vlan and ip".
Futhermore, the Packet::IPHeaderOffset has to adjusted to 18.
