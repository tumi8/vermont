REQUIREMENTS
------------

VERMONT has been tested on Linux and FreeBSD systems.

For compilation, GNU C/C++ compiler and standard libraries are required,
as well as the following Ubuntu/Debian packages (or equivalent packages
of other Linux distributions):
 - cmake 
 - libboost-filesystem-dev
 - libboost-regex-dev
 - libboost-test-dev
 - libxml2-dev 
 - libpcap-dev 
 - libsctp-dev (if not available, disable cmake option SUPPORT_SCTP)

The following packages are optional:
 - cmake-curses-gui (ccmake, interactive user interface of cmake)
 - libpq-dev (for PostGreSQL support)
    ==> cmake option SUPPORT_PGSQL
 - libmysqlclient-dev (for MySQL support)
    ==> cmake option SUPPORT_MYSQL
 - libgsl-dev (for connection-based sampling with Bloom filters)
    ==> cmake option USE_GSL


-------------------------
BUILDING AND INSTALLATION
-------------------------

This project uses cmake for setting platform- and user-specific compile 
options. In order to generate the Makefile for actual compilation, you 
need to call in the root of the source directory:

$ cmake .

In order to change the default compile options, use:

$ cmake -D OPTION1=value1 -D OPTION2=value2 ...

To get a list of the most important options, call:

$ cmake -LH
   
As a user-friendly alternative, you can use the interactive user 
interface:

$ ccmake .

If some libraries are installed in custom directories, use:

$ cmake -D CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/custom/directory1:/custom/directory2

After successfully generating the Makefile with cmake, start the 
compilation with:

$ make

Although not strictly necessary, VERMONT binaries and data files can be 
copied to the usual install location by running:

$ make install 


-----------------------
USAGE AND CONFIGURATION
-----------------------

In order to run VERMONT, a configuration file is needed which specifies the 
modules to be used and their parameters:

$ ./vermont -f <config-file>

Example configuration files can be found in configs/.
A documentation of the available modules and their configuration parameters
can be found at http://vermont.berlios.de/vermont_module_configuration .
A snapshot of this file is located at docs/config/. 

Use Ctrl-C to stop VERMONT. If VERMONT does not exit properly, enter Ctrl-C
for a second time.


--------------------------------------
TRAFFIC CAPTURING AT VLAN MIRROR PORTS
--------------------------------------

VERMONT can be used to capture traffic at a mirror port of a switch. If
the mirror port is configured for VLAN traffic, the Ethernet frames will
usually include a VLAN tag in the Ethernet header, increasing the header 
length from 14 to 18 bytes.

In order to capture such traffic correctly, you need to set the cmake 
option IP_HEADER_OFFSET to 18. Furthermore, make sure that the observer
is configured with <pap_filter> parameter set to "vlan and ip".


----------------------------------------------------
OPERATION AS COLLECTOR: TUNING SOCKET RECEIVE BUFFER
----------------------------------------------------

VERMONT can be used as an IPFIX/PSAMP and NetFlow.v9 collector. As the 
incoming IPFIX/PSAMP/NetFlow messages usually arrive in bursts, losses 
may occur due to insufficient buffer space.

As a solution, the socket receive buffer can be increased. To check the
current settings, use the following system calls on Linux systems with 
/proc file system:

$ cat /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_default
$ cat /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max

In order to configure a new value X (in bytes), call:

$ sysctl -w net/core/rmem_default=X
$ sysctl -w net/core/rmem_max=X


------------------------------------
OPTIMIZED PACKET CAPTURING WITH PCAP
------------------------------------

To reduce the number of times packets need to be copied on their way from
the network interface card to the user space (i.e., VERMONT), we recommend 
the utilization of pcap library 1.0.0 or higher.

For earlier versions of pcap, the pcap-mmap patch can be applied to 
improve the performance: http://public.lanl.gov/cpw/


-------------------------------------
EFFECTS OF RECEIVE OFFLOAD MECHANISMS
-------------------------------------

Several mechanisms have been implemented in modern network interface cards,
drivers, and kernels to offload common functions from the protocol stack and 
the application. One particular focus is on TCP segmentation and reassembly.

Receive offload mechanisms aim at reassembling subsequent TCP segments into
a single large packet before passing it to the IP/TCP protocol stack and 
finally to the application. In the Linux kernel, this is done by generic 
receive offload (GRO) if the network interface card and the driver support 
NAPI. Latest Intel 10GE controllers (e.g., 82599) support receive side 
coalescing (RSC) which performs TCP reassembly in hardware.

If any receive offload mechanism is enabled, VERMONT (like any other 
pcap-based application) does not observe the actually captured TCP packets 
but the reassembled ones. One consequence is that packet counts of flows will 
be smaller than the true number of packets.

In order to avoid such distortions, all receive offload mechanisms need to 
be disabled. In the case of GRO (and the older LRO), this can be done with 
ethtool. The following call returns a list of the current status of all 
offload mechanisms for interface <dev>:

$ ethtool -k <dev>

If GRO is not shown, you probably need to install a newer version of ethtool.
To disable GRO (and LRO), execute:

$ ethtool -K <dev> gro off
$ ethtool -K <dev> lro off

Hardware-based RSC can be deactivated at compile time of the driver as
